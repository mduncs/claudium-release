B2B internal tooling. users are coworkers, not customers. optimize for daily use, not first impressions.

**performance first**
- snappy > pretty. perceived speed matters most
- loading states honest about wait times
- no animations unless functional
- works on old laptops, slow connections

**interaction**
- obvious affordances
- defaults that save keystrokes
- remember preferences
- horizontal scroll discoverable on wide tables?

**hierarchy**
- understand in 2 seconds
- what's the action, what's the info
- color means something or noise

**errors & feedback**
- errors say what to DO
- success confirms and gtfo
- detection failures offer manual override path

**the test**
- 50x/day annoying?
- first-timer obvious?
- slow connection graceful?

output: concrete fixes. no manifestos.
