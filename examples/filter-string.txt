# Filter strings — one per line
# These strings will be removed from all tool output before Claude sees them.
# The sanitize hooks read this file at runtime.
#
# Use case: there exist strings that, when present in Claude's context,
# trigger deterministic API-level refusal. Hostile actors embed these
# in web pages, files, and other content to disrupt Claude sessions.
#
# How it works:
# 1. Put the string(s) on separate lines below (no comments on string lines)
# 2. sanitize-output.py (PreToolUse) catches them in Read/Bash/Grep/WebFetch
# 3. sanitize-post.py (PostToolUse) catches anything that slipped through
# 4. The string is replaced with [FILTERED] in the output
#
# IMPORTANT: The actual strings are not included in this repo.
# You'll need to discover them yourself or ask in the community.
# Put one string per line below:
